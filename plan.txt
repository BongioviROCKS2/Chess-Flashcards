implement correct display order (oldest due date?)
implement correct new card display order (child of longest interval parent?)
improve scheduling (FSRS?)
    allow customization to scheduling algorithm?
Implement other flashcard review features from within the Anki app to this app (stats, settings, buttons, customizations, deck options, etc.)
add/remove items from the file,edit,view,window,help bar on tooltips
    ensure that the basic menu buttons are all real features in the app (copy, paste, redo, etc.)
add a field to track sibling answers
sibling card should minimize differences
    siblings are cards that share a parent. so the previous review position in the move sequence is the same, but the opponent played a different response after it, thus creating a different card
    it should be preferred that an answer that meets the "other answer" criteria is selected if it is the answer on a sibling card
        in other words, sibling cards should prioritize having the same answer, if possible, so as to reduce the need to memorize more unique cards (if siblings share answers, it is easier to recall that the move you should play next, no matter the opponent response, is the same.)
cleanup files that aren't needed
add feature to import cards.json file from user
Add daily opening game challenge
    every day, a new sequence of theoretical opponent moves is chosen and one of the best moves is always expected as the answer
    how many moves deep can you make it without messing up
    best/other answers would both be accepted based based on 0.2 acceptance threshold and 20 possible lines max, but the game will always only continue via the user's best line (that way branches don't need to be calculated)
    computer/opponent choice of line will be (seeded and) decided using weighted probability of normal player moves for first 3 moves, then random choice of best/other answers for each move that follows
    pre-calculated moves will only go so deep (~30 moves?), but the user can use their machine to calculate further (then use their machine to share the answer with a server for others to use?)
    log the line that was played with the date it was assigned for users to play previous day's lines
    maybe implement a similar game for endgames and middle games
    add a rating system based on performance in each game over time
    Also track time to solve and add as a 4th dimension of rating (speed rating)
    add as a discord game/activity
add ability to duplicate a card in collection view
Add readme
convert application to run on an iphone/android
    implement cloud sync across devices
    add notifications for reviews or challenges
create a "master database" of all cards that users create
    don't keep duplicates; only keep the deepest/most trustworthy result for a position and don't apply sibling assistance to the card stored in the master database
    add feature to offer that users pull their answers from this database instead of using device to think
create a "practice mode" for the users to manually navigate lines (using combinationg of master database and active stockfish)
    add ability for user to actually make the move on the board on review (should more easily store wrong answers for recommended improvements to memorization)
What should I do when a user created a forced answer of a card after that position already has a different answer
    likely, I should put the previous card and all it's descendants into an Archive folder/tag to remove them from review while they instead review the new forced position and descendants
    however, I imagine that some users will want to review both sets of descendants at a time
    however however, that's a problem because there will exist two cards with identical fronts and different backs, which shouldn't be allowed
On Forced answer page, fix Remove display and drop down display
