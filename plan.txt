use chess.com username to scan all historical games by that user for auto add card creation
    cards should be created using the following criteria for scanning a game:
        1. check if the game has been previously scanned
        2a. if the game has been previously scanned, skip that game. Load the next game to be scanned and revert to step 1.
        2b. if the game has not been previously scanned, begin with the first move of a game and proceed to step 3
        3. check if that position exists in cards.json
        4a. if the position exists in cards.json, no need to analyze the position. Go to step 5
        4b. if the position does not exist in cards.json, run make-card on that position, then go to step 5
        5. check what move the user played when in that position in that game.
        6a. if in the game being scanned the user played the move that stockfish deemed as best, continue to step 7.
        6b. if in the game being scanned the user did not play the move that stockfish deemed as best, move to the next game that the user played and revert to step 1. Repeat until no games are left to scan.
        7. add the user's move and the opponent's move to the review pgn for a new card to be added, then revert to step 2 to create that next card.
