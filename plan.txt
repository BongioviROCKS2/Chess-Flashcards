create the deck manage page for various deck-specific settings
    add ability to export individual decks from the deck manage page
remove formatting bugs on collection page
improve stats page to include more review stats, including one like what the Anki app has
use chess.com username to scan all historical games by that user for auto add card creation
    if the games have been previously scanned, log them so they do not get scanned on the next auto add
review title should say full deck name (ex. Openings/White/Other) for that card, not just the deepest subdeck
make sure keybind to flip board button in review is functional
Make it so the review buttons can be hovered over to see the keybind

Future:
add a field to track sibling answers to minimize differences
add/remove items from the file,edit,view,window,help bar on tooltips
    ensure that the basic menu buttons are all real features in the app (copy, paste, redo, etc.)
cleanup files that aren't needed
Implement other flashcard review features from within the Anki app to this app (stats, settings, buttons, customizations, etc.)
